## REFLECTION
Despite being relatively pleased with how the project turned out there were a few things that I didnâ€™t get a chance to add that I wish I could have added. First and foremost, I wish I had added more guns than just the one in the demo. I had plans to add an assault rifle this would have been relatively simple as the bullet fire and casing eject script was already created all I would of had to do was get an assault rifle model and mark where the bullet was fired from and where the casings come out and have a constant fire rate from the gun. Another thing I wanted to add was limited ammo for the gun. This would have added a resource management element to the game. The zombies would have dropped ammo on the ground upon their death. Again, this would have had to have gone hand in hand with the multiple guns as if you ran out of ammo with the pistol you would have been completely defenceless. And the opposite if there was no resource management with the assault rifle then users would just constantly mow down zombies using the rifle and would never have a need for the pistol. 
I also would have liked to have added a selection of zombie types add some variety to the gameplay. Like a zombie that would like to stay at a distance and throw projectiles at the player. I also was planning an enemy that would buff the zombies around them so the player would have to focus their attention on them before battling the rest of the horde.
